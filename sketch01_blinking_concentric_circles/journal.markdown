I did not expect such a cool pattern! The blinking circles are futuristic, they remind me of Tron haha.
Hmmm I try to ticker around the parameters, and background(55) & noFill() & stroke(~random colors~) work best visually.

_Programming Issue 1_

Why the pattern stop changing each frame once I delete the "n" from the parameters?
~n -> generation for fractals~
